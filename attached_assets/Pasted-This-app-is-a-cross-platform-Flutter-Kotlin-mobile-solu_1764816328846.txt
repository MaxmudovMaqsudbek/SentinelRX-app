This app is a cross-platform Flutter/Kotlin mobile solution that combines AI, computer vision, and data analytics to create a smart medication assistant. It is designed for ease-of-use (no login required) and a modern, engaging UI. The goal is to scan pills, check interactions, give personalized advice, and even flag counterfeit risks in real time. As one guide notes, “pill identifier apps” use AI image recognition to identify medication by photo or description and then provide details like name, dosage, usage, side effects, and interactions

Feature 1: Visual Pill Recognition

We implement an on-device pill scanner using a CNN (e.g. MobileNetV2) for image analysis. Users point their camera at a tablet; the app identifies it by shape, color, imprint and reads any text imprint via OCR. The system then looks up the pill’s identity and dosage in a drug database. This builds on known “pill identifier” technology – AI image recognition matched against a large medication database

dynamsoft.com
. For example, if a patient receives a loose pill with no packaging, they can simply scan it and the app returns the exact drug name and strength. Key capabilities include:

CNN classification (MobileNetV2) trained on thousands of pill images.

Imprint OCR to read letters/numbers stamped on pills.

AR overlay (optional) to highlight detected pills and display information in real time. Such AR-enhanced lookup has been used to scan barcodes/labels to fetch drug details

A clean UI: large photo preview and simple results screen (see image above). Flutter and Material 3 will ensure a crisp modern interface

Feature 2: Drug Interaction Checker

The app includes a DrugBank-powered drug interaction AI. When the user scans or enters multiple medications, the system queries a drug-interaction API (e.g. DrugBank’s DDI API
go.drugbank.com
blog.drugbank.com
). This returns any known interactions, their severity, and management advice. For example, combining warfarin and acetaminophen would be flagged with “moderate” risk and a description
go.drugbank.com
. We map scanned drug IDs to active ingredients (DrugBank IDs) and call the interaction endpoint, which can handle up to 40 drugs at once
go.drugbank.com
. The app then warns the user with a clear score (minor/moderate/major) and suggests alternatives if needed. This real-time interaction checking helps patients and doctors avoid harmful combinations

.

Feature 3: Personalized Safety Advice

The AI provides tailored alerts based on age, pregnancy, allergies, and chronic conditions. For example, the app knows which drugs are unsafe in early pregnancy (e.g. NSAIDs) and will warn pregnant users
webmd.com
. Similarly, it checks allergies by scanning a user profile or prompt. Age-based dose guidelines and adjustments for kidney or liver disease can be integrated. If a scanned painkiller is risky for a 1st-trimester pregnant woman, the app alerts “Not recommended during first trimester” and suggests safer alternatives. This draws on medical guidelines to customize the advice. (While explicit APIs for this are limited, we implement rule-based checks and link to clinical sources.) Note: As a precaution, the system emphasizes verified medical content and advises consulting a doctor for critical cases.

Feature 4: Price Anomaly Detection

We continuously scrape pharmacy and online prices (via APIs or web) and use ML analytics to spot outliers. Counterfeit or unauthorized sellers often list medicines at implausibly low prices. The app flags these by statistical anomaly detection. For instance, if a drug normally costs 25 000 soʻm but is offered at 7 000 soʻm, the app marks it “SUSPICIOUS – 87% likely counterfeit” based on price-distribution models. In AI terms, machine learning can detect anomalies in pricing and sales data
africanscholarpub.com
. Specifically, algorithms analyze patterns (low price * quantity*, unusual sellers) to assign a “counterfeit risk score.” Users are alerted to avoid risky sellers. This builds on research showing AI can spot counterfeit drugs through data patterns and image/label anomalies

.

Feature 5: Nearest Verified Pharmacy Locator

This feature uses the Google Places/Maps API to list genuine nearby pharmacies. We mark “verified” pharmacies (e.g. registered chains) and show distance/walking time on a map. The app also checks real-time inventory via pharmacy APIs (where available). Users can filter for 24/7 pharmacies. For example, a diabetic patient seeking insulin sees nearby pharmacies sorted by distance (e.g. “650 m, 8 min walk”) and whether the drug is in stock. Google’s Places API easily returns nearby pharmacies with opening hours and directions
developers.google.com
. We use Flutter’s Google Maps plugin for maps/directions. This ensures users find a valid pharmacy quickly, improving medication access.

Feature 6: Predictive Batch Recall Alerts

Leveraging user reports and public data, the app analyzes adverse event patterns to preempt recalls. If many users report side effects from a specific lot number (e.g. “Batch A93KD881”), the system uses NLP and time-series analysis to detect a signal. AI-powered pharmacovigilance techniques scan these reports (like social listening or app feedback) for unusual spikes
imergey.com
. When a threshold is crossed, the batch is flagged “Potential Risk.” This can occur weeks before an official recall. AI models can automatically detect unusual patterns in adverse-event data far faster than manual review
imergey.com
. Users and providers are then warned, enabling early action (return drugs, consult doctors).

Feature 7: Multilingual Voice Assistant (UZ/EN/RU)

A voice-first chatbot makes the app accessible to elderly or low-literacy users. Using speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) libraries (e.g. Google Cloud STT/TTS or OpenAI’s new audio API), users can ask questions by voice in Uzbek, Russian, or English. The app detects language (via device locale or an API like Google Translate’s detect feature) and processes the question through the OpenAI API to generate a natural-language answer. For example, an Uzbek-speaking grandmother asks, “Bu dorini xavfsizmi?” (“Is this medicine safe?”). The app responds verbally in Uzbek: “Ha, xavfsiz. Ovqat bilan qabul qiling.” Technical implementation uses Flutter packages for STT/TTS, and calls OpenAI’s GPT for intelligent responses

. (OpenAI’s API can also provide multilingual TTS and voice input in 11 languages

.) This voice agent feels conversational and adapts to the user’s language, making the app inclusive

Feature 8: Family & Caregiver Panel

Relatives or caregivers can monitor a patient’s medication adherence via a shared dashboard. Each dose intake is logged; if a scheduled dose is missed, the app sends an alert. The panel can track multiple family members in one interface. For instance, a son living abroad can view his mother’s medication log and see “today: took 2 of 3 pills.” If a dose is missed, he receives an immediate notification to remind her. This draws on existing medication apps: e.g. Medisafe lets users share adherence reports with caregivers
goodrx.com
. We implement secure data syncing (e.g. via cloud) so family can only see schedules/logs, not personal data. The panel also shows simple charts of dose history and sends automatic SMS/call reminders if needed. This feature boosts adherence and peace-of-mind for families.

Feature 9: Gamification & Rewards

To encourage engagement, the app gamifies key actions: scanning pills, reporting fakes, and consistency. Users earn points for desirable behaviors (e.g. scan a new drug: 10 points; report counterfeit: 50 points; 7-day streak: 25 bonus; complete monthly task: 100 points). These can be redeemed for real rewards (e.g. 5% pharmacy discount for 200 points, 10% for 500, free consultation for 1000 points). This mirrors loyalty programs: GoodRx’s app awards points redeemable for discounts
goodrx.com
. Research shows gamified incentives (points, streaks, badges) boost app usage and adherence
clevertap.com
. The UI will feature a progress dashboard (like a leveling meter) and clear rewards catalog. By turning compliance into a game, we motivate users to regularly use the scanner and report issues, improving overall safety.

Feature 10: Medical Tourism Mode

For travelers, the app auto-detects language and local currency. When a user opens the app in, say, Uzbekistan, it switches to their preferred language (detected by Google’s locale services) and displays prices in their home currency via a real-time currency API. It also maps foreign medication names to local equivalents: we use the WHO’s ATC classification system to match drugs by therapeutic class
who.int
. For example, if a Russian tourist scans a local drug, the app finds its INN/ATC code and looks up the equivalent Russian-brand drug. Currency conversion (via an API like exchangeratesapi.io) updates prices on the fly. The interface offers a comfortable UX in the user’s language with familiar terms (e.g. “Analogs of [drug] in Russia”). This mode is crucial for safe care abroad.

Feature 11: AI Orchestration Layer

Behind the scenes, an orchestration engine efficiently runs all AI modules in parallel and returns a unified response in under 1 second. Flutter’s concurrency (Dart isolates) lets us make non-blocking API calls and on-device inferences concurrently
docs.flutter.dev
. For example, when scanning a pill, the app simultaneously: runs image classification, queries the drug DB, checks interactions, verifies pharmacy inventory, and updates gamification points. Using asynchronous Future.wait or isolates, all tasks proceed without freezing the UI
docs.flutter.dev
. The results are aggregated into one smart response. This architecture leverages multi-core execution so even with 11 sub-services active, the user sees one coherent answer almost instantly.
